## Overview

Hey! Here’s a quick rundown of what I’ve been up to in my CS 330: Computer Graphics and Visualization class at SNHU Online. This course was my entry point into the fascinating world of 3D graphics using OpenGL and C++. I started with some basic tutorials, but things got really interesting when I developed the `SceneBuilder` and `ShapeBuilder` classes from the ground up. These classes made it so much easier to create and render objects in a 3D scene. My final project is a perfect example of how these classes work together to create something pretty cool and user-friendly.

Over the semester, I tackled several projects that helped me get a solid understanding of 3D modeling, texturing, and lighting. The final project, which I’m really proud of, is a complete 3D scene that brings together everything I learned. It’s been a tough journey, but super rewarding.

If you’re into coding and 3D graphics, you might find my code helpful. I’ve thoroughly commented on the `SceneBuilder.cpp` file to guide anyone looking to create and render shapes in a 3D environment.

## Final Project: A 3D Desk Scene

Here’s a look at my final project—a detailed 3D desk scene featuring a laptop, a cup of pencils, and a few other desk essentials. The aim was to make everything look as realistic as possible by carefully modeling each object, applying accurate textures, and setting up dynamic lighting.

### Scene Overview

This is the full desk setup, where I focused on capturing the little details to make the scene feel like an actual workspace.

### Pencil Cup

The pencil cup was built using hollow cylinders, and I spent quite a bit of time getting the textures just right to make it look natural.

### Laptop

The laptop’s buttons and screen were textured to create the illusion of depth, even though the surface is flat.

### Scene Builder and Shape Builder Algorithms

I wrote all the algorithms for creating the objects in this scene from scratch. These handle everything from building the shapes to applying the textures.

## The Final Product: The Desk Scene

For the final project, a key requirement was to incorporate multiple light sources and make the scene interactive. The animation below shows how the lights interact with the objects. The camera controls include `WASD` for movement, `QE` for altitude adjustments, and the mouse wheel to change speed. You can also change the view with the mouse, and there’s a wireframe mode you can toggle with the arrow keys.
